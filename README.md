# Chinese Poetry Generation
This project aims to implement and improve upon the classical Chinese poetry generation system proposed in ["Chinese Poetry Generation with Planning based Neural Network"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09889).

## Project Structure
**Data**  
`data`: directory for `raw` data, `processed` data, pre-processed `starterkit` data, and generated poetry `samples`  
`model`: directory for saved neural network models  
`log`: directory for training logs  
`notebooks`: directory for exploratory/experimental IPython notebooks  
`training_scripts`: directory for sample scripts used for training several basic models  

**Code**  
`model.py`: graph definition  
`train.py`: training logic  
`predict.py`: prediction logic  
`plan.py`: keyword planning logic  
`main.py`: user interaction program  

## Data Processing
To prepare training data:
```sh
python data_utils.py
```

> **Detail**  
> This scrip does the following in order:    
> 1. Parse corpus  
> 2. Build vocab  
> 3. Filter quatrains  
> 4. Count words  
> 5. Rank words  
> 6. Generate training data  

> **Note**  
> The TextRank algorithm may take many hours to run.  
> Instead, you can choose to interrupt the iterations and stop it early,  
> when the progress shown in the terminal has remained stationary for a long time.  
  
Then, to generate the word embedding:
```sh
python word2vec.py
```

> **Alternative**  
> As an alternative, we have also provided pre-processed data in the `data/starterkit` directory  
> You may simply perform `cp data/starterkit/* data/processed` to skip the data processing step  

## Training

To train the default model:
```sh
python train.py
```

To view the full list of configurable training parameters:
```sh
python train.py -h
```

> **Note**  
> Thus you should almost always train a new model after modifying any of the parameters.  
> Models are by default saved to `model/`. To train a new model, you may either remove the existing model from `model/`  
> or specify a new model path during training with `python train.py --model_dir :new_model:dir:`  


## Generating

To start the user interation program:
```sh
python main.py
```

Similarly, to view the full list of configurable predicting parameters:
```sh
python main.py -h
```

> **Note**  
> The program currently does not check that predication parameters matches corresponding training parameters.  
> User has to ensure, in particular, the data loading modes correspond with the ones used during traing.  
> (e.g. If training data is `reversed` and `aligned`, then prediction input should also be `reversed` and `aligned`.  
> Otherwise, results may range from subtle differences in output to total crash.  

## Evaluating

To generate sample poems for evaluation:
```sh
python generate_samples.py
```

> **Detail**  
> This script by default randomly samples 4000 poems from the training data and saves them as `human` poems.
> Then it uses entire poems as inputs to the planner, to create keywords for the predictor.
> The predicted poems are saved as `machine` poems.

To evaluate the generated poems:
```sh
python evaluate.py
```
